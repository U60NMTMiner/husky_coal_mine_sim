For the move_to_points_relative node: make sure that to run the following commands:
. devel setup.bash
roslaunch husky_coal_gazebo move_to_points_relative.launch (this will cause an error, but needs to be run for the python file to work).
rosrun husky_coal_gazebo move_to_points_relative.py

It will constantly throw warnings (similar to running the husky coalpen), but it does seem to work correctly. 
 
 
For the topic_moniter, make sure to run it in the following format rosrun husky_coal_gazebo topic_moniter.py /topic_name

It will print out the data every 1 second but that can be changed in the python file. It should correctly import any needed modules to read the messages but I have only tested it with a few of them.
